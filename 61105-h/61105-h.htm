<h2 id="c1"><span class="small">BASIC NEEDS AND KNOW HOW....</span></h2>
<p><b>YARNS</b>: Yarns vary in size, twist
and texture. Use the &ldquo;<b>Dawn</b>&rdquo; Yarn
indicated in the directions as only
an experienced expert knitter
knows how to allow for the difference
when a substitution is made.
It is also very important to purchase
all the yarn needed at one
time as different dye lots frequently
have different shades of
color.</p>
<p>When you purchase your yarn always
check the dye lot number to
make certain they are all the same.
It is much wiser to purchase a little
extra yarn than to try and
match the dye lot after your garment
is finished. Though the color
may look the same in the skein
more often than not the difference
will be seen in the finished work.
The &ldquo;ply&rdquo; of yarn means the number
of strands twisted together.
This can be seen by taking the end
of the yarn and untwisting.</p>
<h3 id="c2">FUNDAMENTALS &amp; SOME TIPS</h3>
<p>Learn the basic stitches. There are
only three: Knit, Purl and slip. All
the others are produced by variations
and in combination with yarn
overs. See <a href="#Page_10">page 10</a>.</p>
<p>Practice first with heavy yarn and
thick needles. Study the stitch and
the position it takes on the needle.
Follow arrows in illustration. Learn
to recognize when it is wrong.
Watch the yarn to see where each
loop of the stitch begins and ends.
If you lay your knitting aside for
a few days or longer, always rip
back a few rows before starting
again. This will prevent an uneven
row. See <a href="#Page_12">page 12</a> for ripping back.</p>
<p><b>Parentheses</b> in our instructions are
used for an explanation of a st, a
certain section of a garment, or
change of sts for change of size.
A <b>ROW</b> is once across the needle.
A <b>RIDGE</b> is 2 rows, back and forth.
<b>WORK EVEN</b>, means to continue
in pattern st keeping the continuity
of the design.</p>
<p>Always <b>MEASURE</b> straight up and
down unless otherwise stated.</p>
<h3 id="c3">WINDING WOOL</h3>
<p>Winding the wool correctly is important.
Never wind wool tightly
as this stretches it. Wind several
strands around fingers, slip these
from fingers. Over these strands,
in opposite direction, wind a few
more strands wrapping yarn
around fingers and ball. Continue
in this manner, always winding
over fingers and in opposite direction
from last winding.</p>
<p><b>LEFT HAND KNITTING</b>: Follow
the instructions but change your
copy to read left hand where it
says &ldquo;right hand&rdquo; and vice versa.
Use a mirror to study diagrams and
charts. This will reverse the image
for you.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p><b>JOINING YARNS</b> ... If possible,
join the new yarn with a knot at
the beginning of a row. If this cannot
be done, work next st with new
yarn leaving a 4 inch length. Work
a few sts, tie the ends firmly and
with a yarn needle weave ends
into work.</p>
<p><b>MARKER</b> ... This term is used
whenever it is important that a
certain point is to be marked. Example:
increase, decrease, beginning
of a row or round, buttonholes,
center st, etc. To make a
marker of yarn, use a different
color; make a slip knot leaving
ends about 2 inches in length.
Place on needle as directed. Slip
marker off one needle to the other
needle in each successive round.</p>
<p><b>MULTIPLE OF STS</b> ... This term
is used generally at beginning of
directions and means that a certain
multiple of sts is necessary to
work one pattern. Example: multiple
of 4 sts would mean any number
divisible by 4 or 12, 16, 24 sts,
etc. A multiple of 4 plus 2 would
be 14, 18, 26 sts, etc., or any number
that has 2 more sts after dividing
by 4.</p>
<h3 id="c4">NEEDLE TYPES</h3>
<p><b>STRAIGHT NEEDLES</b> ... are used
when working back and forth in
rows. They come in lengths of 10,
12, and 14 inches and sizes O-1-2-3,
etc. The larger the number,
the thicker the needle.</p>
<p><b>DOUBLE POINTED NEEDLES</b> ...
come in sets of 4 or 5. They are
used for socks, mittens and any
articles made in rounds.</p>
<p><b>CIRCULAR NEEDLES</b> ... are used
in making skirts, or parts of garments
when a seam is not desired;
also in completing a large doily or
a round tablecloth.</p>
<p><b>Directions</b> give the size and type
needle required and it is not advisable
to change the size unless
it is necessary in order to obtain
the correct gauge.</p>
<p><b>CABLE NEEDLES</b> ... are short
with a bend in the center to hold
sts from slipping off. They are
available in thin or thick size for
the different yarns. A short double
pointed needle may also be
used. It is a good idea after placing
sts on the straight needle to be
used for cable to stick needle into
garment slightly, this will prevent
sts from slipping off needle.</p>
<p><b>STITCH HOLDERS</b> ... are used to
hold sts to be used later. Example:
sts at back of neck or when all sts
are cast on and worked to armholes,
then divided for front and
back. The stitch holders can be
purchased or a safety pin or length
of yarn may be used.</p>
<p><b>STITCH COUNTERS</b> ... usually
placed on knitting needles. They
have a dial and after working a
row, turn the dial to the next number.</p>
<p><b>BOBBINS</b> ... usually made of
plastic to hold small amounts of
yarn for use in making argyle socks
or the Fair Isle, Scandinavian or
Ski patterns.</p>
<p><b>GAUGE</b> ... The stitch gauge which
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
appears at the beginning of all instructions
is most important to
the size and fit of your garment.
Before starting, make a sample
swatch of the pattern stitch with
the needles and yarn specified. If
you have MORE sts than gauge
use LARGER needles. If you have
LESS sts than gauge use SMALLER
needles. Check your gauge as you
progress to assure a perfectly sized
garment, Ill. No. 1.</p>

yarn to the wrong side unless directed
otherwise.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<h3 id="c17">PICKING UP STITCHES .... DROPPED ST ...</h3>
<p>In stockinette
stitch pick up stitch on right side
of work. Using a crochet hook, insert
hook in dropped st, draw yarn
to row above through loop forming
a new loop. Continue in this manner
until you reach the row being
worked being careful not to twist
the sts. (Ill. No. 30). <b>PURL</b> sts are
picked up by inserting crochet
hook through dropped st from in
back of sts. (Ill. No. 31). In <b>GARTER
STITCH</b> alternate the two
movements. <b>RIPPING BACK</b>:
Unravel work to within the last
row of point desired. Rip the last
row a stitch at a time placing each
stitch on a free needle, preferably
a finer double pointed needle,
then place these sts back on size
needle you are using. Continue
knitting as directed.</p>

<p>around neck and armholes is usually
done with smaller needles.
Hold the work with right side toward
you and work from right to
left. Insert right needle into the
first st from edge, pick up stitches
(Ill. No. 32). When picking up
stitches on an irregular edge be
sure to pick up a stitch in every
row. Always work with the right
side toward you unless otherwise
directed.</p>

<h3 id="c19">BUTTONHOLES</h3>
<p>Work to the point specified. Bind
off three or more stitches according
to directions and work to end
of row. In the following row work
to the bound off sts and cast on the
same number of stitches bound off
in previous row and complete row.

<p>Cut yarn leaving about a 14 inch
length, thread this into a darning
needle, * insert needle through
first st of first needle as if knitting
and slip stitch off needle, pass
through next stitch as if purling
and leave stitch on needle, draw
yarn through first st of back needle
as if purling and slip stitch off

<h3 id="c21">DUPLICATE STITCH</h3>
<p>This is the stitch used most often
for embroidering a desired motif
on a knitted article. It is worked
by: * bringing needle through center
of stitch from the wrong side
to right side of work&mdash;see ill. A.
Following the outline of the knit
stitch above, draw the yarn across
the back of the two strands of this
stitch&mdash;see ill. A and B&mdash;return
needle to the center of the same
stitch&mdash;see ill. B&mdash;and draw yarn
through. Repeat from * starting
next stitch by bringing needle
through center of stitch to be duplicated&mdash;see

<h3 id="c22">CHANGING COLORS....</h3>
<p>At the end of a row, tie in new color and
continue in pattern. In Scandinavian,
Fair Isle or Ski patterns the
additional colors are carried on the
wrong side of work. Designs of
this type are usually worked from
a chart with a color code. When
changing colors always twist yarns
around each other to prevent a
hole. If color is carried over more
than 4 sts, the carried color should
be twisted around the yarn that is
being worked to prevent loose
lengths on wrong side. Twist the
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
yarn in following manner; pick up
carried color, before knitting st in
usual manner twist over yarn that
is carried. Cut colors only when
you are through with that color
leaving about a 4 or 5 inch length
to be fastened later with a yarn
sewing needle. If designs to be
worked are separated or only 1 design
is worked in a corner of garment,
use bobbins (see <a href="#Page_6">page 6</a>)
to work design.</p>

<h3 id="c25">CHILD&rsquo;S or IN-BETWEEN SIZE</h3>
<p>If child&rsquo;s garment is desired or if
you are not a regular size, work as
follows:</p>
<p>(1) Take chest or bust measure.
Divide the figure in half (half
is front, half is back).</p>
<p>(2) Multiply this figure (the
half of chest measure) by sts (or
rows) necessary to equal gauge.</p>
<p>(3) Follow directions given,
working back and front to desired
length to underarm. Work armhole
shaping in proportion to directions
given. Work armhole desired
length. Shape shoulder proportionately
to directions being
followed. Work sleeves in proportion
to added or subtracted sts.</p>
<p>(4) Always have same number
of rows on back and front of
sweater. Work same amount of
rows for both sleeves.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_15">15</div>
<h3 id="c26">BLOCKING AND FINISHING</h3>
<p>Blocking is method used to shape
a garment for a &ldquo;professional
look&rdquo;. Steps to follow:</p>
<p><b>1</b>&mdash;Conceal all ends: run ends
through several stitches on wrong
side. If yarn is heavy or bulky, split
strand and run ends through several
stitches.</p>
<p><b>2</b>&mdash;Determine whether garment
is to be washed. If so, wash each
section separately by hand or
machine wash garment according
to specific instructions on
yarn label or commercial laundering
product. Most garments
stretch larger when wet. Care,
therefore, should be taken in handling
wet sections. Squeeze gently
in the washing, DO NOT TWIST
or WRING. Rinse thoroughly.
Place in turkish towel and squeeze
out excess moisture. Place on turkish
towel to dry. If sections of garment
appear to be too big, adjust
sections to measure by pushing
sections into slight puckers. Puckers
will disappear when sections
dry.</p>
<p><b>3</b>&mdash;Always use the stitch gauge
given as a guide for blocking. Instructions
are written for the average
in any size, see <a href="#Page_14">page 14</a> for
our sizes. Any slight adjustment
for individual size should be made
in the blocking.</p>
<p><b>4</b>&mdash;After measurements have been
determined, place the sections individually
and wrong side up on a
well padded surface or table. It is
sometimes helpful to draw outline
on brown paper or heavy tissue paper.
With rust proof pins, pin each
section to measurement spacing
pins about &frac12; inch apart.</p>
<p><b>5</b>&mdash;Place a wet pressing cloth over
a section. Using a rotary motion,
hold iron as close as possible to
section allowing steam to penetrate,
but DO NOT at any time let
iron rest on garment. Leave sections
on pressing table until thoroughly
dry.... Do not hurry this
process.</p>
<p><b>6</b>&mdash;Always bear in mind that
cables and rib patterns have a tendency
to pull in or shrink back.
Each section should be blocked
about 2 inches more than desired
measure, but should NEVER be
pressed flat. Also some patterns
are especially designed for a textured
effect. They too should
NEVER be pressed flat. Never
press ribbing of cuffs, waistband
or neckline.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07.jpg" alt="{unlabelled}" width="400" height="232" />
</div>
<p><b>7</b>&mdash;After all sections have been
blocked garment is now ready for
finishing. Seams may be woven
(see <a href="#Page_31">illustrations for weaving lengthwise and crosswise seams</a>)
or back stitched (see illustration
<a href="#Page_31">page 31</a>), or by sewing machine.
<b>To weave lengthwise seam</b>: thread
tapestry needle with a single strand
of matching yarn. Hold lengthwise
edges together, right sides up.
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
Insert needle in center of st on
right side, pass under two rows
and pull yarn through to right
side. Insert needle in corresponding
row of left side, draw yarn
through in same way. Work from
side to side in this manner taking
care to keep seam elastic, matching
rows, patterns, stripes, etc. <b>To
weave a crosswise seam</b>: hold
crosswise edges together. Starting
at right edge, insert needle under
two loops of stitch on top section,
insert needle down through center
of next stitch and up through center
of next stitch on lower section.
Continue in same manner working
alternately into top section and
then into lower section until seam
is completed taking care to keep
seam elastic and matching patterns,
etc.</p>
<p>b&mdash;<b>Back stitching</b>: place right
sides of sections to be seamed together.
Pin, keeping edges even
and matching rows or patterns.
With tapestry needle and matching
yarn back stitch close to edge
taking care not to draw stitches
too tight and keeping seam elastic.</p>
<div class="img">
<img src="images/p07b-15c.jpg" alt="{unlabelled}" width="265" height="101" />
</div>
<p>c&mdash;<b>Sewing machine</b>: loosen
tension on machine as you would
for jersey or any stretchy fabric.
Place right sides together and pin.
Baste seam being careful not to
draw stitches too tight. Remove
pins. With matching thread machine
stitch seam. If yarn is bulky
or fuzzy sew over tissue paper.
Remove paper when finished.</p>
<p><b>8</b>&mdash;After garment is all assembled,
carefully steam seams flat
and even.</p>
<h4>TO SHORTEN ...</h4>
<p>(No hem desired).
Determine length you desire;
place a marker. Cut through
one st at side seam about 2 rows
below marker. * Pick up cut end
and draw through several sts, cut
this length close as possible to
work. This drawn length will
tighten sts. After length has been
cut straighten edge taking care
with loose sts. Place loose sts on
free needle. Repeat from * until
row has been ripped and sts have
been placed on needle. With free
needle bind off&mdash;or&mdash;attach yarn
on P side, and with crochet hook
work a slip stitch (see <a href="#Page_30">page 30</a>) in
each st, turn. Work a slip stitch in
each st, cut yarn. If a hem is desired,
allow for hem and complete
same as above. Turn hem to wrong
side and tack in place.</p>
<h4>TO LENGTHEN ...</h4>
<p>(If a sufficient
amount of same dye lot is available).
Cut off cast on edge in same
manner as above. Pick up loose sts
and knit to length desired. If there
is a ribbing on section to be lengthened,
cut into the row above the
ribbing, then add to length. If you
do not have enough of same dye
lot to work garment to length desired,
we suggest working a stripe
of contrasting color and finishing
with same color as garment.</p>
